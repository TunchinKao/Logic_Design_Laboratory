LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell key_de/tone[0]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) state_reg[1]/CLR, state_reg[0]/PRE, AC/cnt_reg[0]/CLR, AC/cnt_reg[10]/CLR,
AC/cnt_reg[11]/CLR, AC/cnt_reg[12]/CLR, AC/cnt_reg[13]/CLR,
AC/cnt_reg[14]/CLR, AC/cnt_reg[15]/CLR, AC/cnt_reg[16]/CLR,
AC/cnt_reg[17]/CLR, AC/cnt_reg[18]/CLR, AC/cnt_reg[19]/CLR,
AC/cnt_reg[1]/CLR, AC/cnt_reg[20]/CLR (the first 15 of 157 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
